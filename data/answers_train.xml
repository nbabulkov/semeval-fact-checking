            <RelCText>If you have been invited for interview in Doha; it's likely (in my opinion) that you will be made an offer. The two days will allow enough time for you to undergo a medical; meet other staff/management; have a look around Doha; at housing available etc. Good luck.</RelCText>

            <RelCText>the interviewing department will endorse their evaluation about you to HR. If positive; HR will send you offer letter.. after you have accepted and agreed the offer; you need to wait 2-3 months (sometimes longer than this period) for visa processing and wait for your schedule of mobiization.</RelCText>

            <RelCText>Yes there are; though it varies depending on which country you come from. In the UK; the doctor has a list of all countries and the vaccinations needed for each. I'll imagine they have the same in the US.</RelCText>

            <RelCText>I suggest going to visit your local GP and mention that you are moving to Qatar. They should have in their system what shots you need before coming over. It is usually for hepatitis and thyfoid i think (please excuse the spelling)</RelCText>

            <RelCText>It depends what you have had already. You don't specifically need any extra vaccinations as long as you are up to date with the usual ones you have in the UK (not sure about US) but you can have Rabies as optional if you want. Although there is no requirement or need to have any extra protection here; it is important to remember that lots of people travel East on holidays and if you do you will need the standard typhoid; yellow fever; etc. Children need to have been vaccinated against TB before they can start school. In the UK they no longer give BCG so important to get that done before you come.</RelCText>

            <RelCText>As I said; the official advice is that you don't HAVE to; however; they may offer you Rabies; Typhoid and Hep B as an option. As they no longer boost Tetanus as routine; you would have to have a booster before coming. That said; the UK has a vey hands off approach to immunisation at the moment as most diseases are sufficiently covered by herd immunity (where because the majority have been vaccinated the people who haven't are covered to a large extent) and cases are low. Personally as long as there is a low risk; I would have all the vaccinations I could; why not?</RelCText>

            <RelCText>In 2006 it was a lovely winter. It was dark; cloudy and rained for almost every day in December. We got trapped in Doha on new years eve and were unable to get to Dukhan such was the torrential rain. It rained on and off until April and then warmed up. The coldest night was 5C but generally 7C. I remember it rained when my parents were here and that was April 2007. This last winter wasn't very cold at all; only a few days of rain and never really got below 10C at night. I love winters here; they are so cosy. On the down side; houses are not built for winter so prepare to freeze and get leaks driping everywhere. The roads don't drain very well so very wet.</RelCText>

Unfortunately I can't tell you what brands are available here since I haven't paid them any attention. I brought my two Britax Boulevards with us from the U.S. and they came through fine. I do recommend purchasing car seat travel bags if you can find them in Norway because it will definitely help keep the cloth cover in better shape. If you can't find them; though; the airline will put it in a very heavy-duty plastic bag. Hope that helps; Expat Sue&#241;o P.S. I am starting a Mums and Kids group here in Doha for expats.

            <RelCText>Hi; I am sure most of the guyz answered your query; if you need more details; read the follwoing: The role of the red blood cells is to carry oxygen through the body. The red blood cells can perform this task because of the presence of hemoglobin; the pigment that is formed when the red blood cells develop in the bone marrow. Each hemoglobin molecule is made up of a protein molecule called globin and four pigmented molecules of a compound called heme. Each heme molecule has one atom of iron; and there are four heme molecules in a single molecule of hemoglobin; hence; a single molecule of hemoglobin has four atoms of iron. This structure makes it possible for one hemoglobin molecule to join with four oxygen molecules to form a substance called oxyhemoglobin. This reaction is reversible; enabling hemoglobin to pick up oxygen when the blood is in the lungs and to release oxygen in the cells when the blood is pumped to the tissues. In general; the blood of men usually has a greater concent.....</RelCText>

One of the component proteins is called alpha; the other is beta. Before birth; the beta protein is not expressed.

            <RelCText>NO. you cant drive with other then GCC license. I also think that I can but law is clear. You need to make all procedure to exchange or make Qatari an driving license. Be sure all stories that you can drive is wrong. If you make any accident then you will see the problems. Best wishes. p.s. if you go to make driving license and you fall...make like I was...give to Sudani man big boss there some money and this is it. I give 1000 QAR and in 3 time I get licence. This is not secret just life in Doha. Corruption every where. Can you imagine that I fall 2 times at driving tests like I dont know how to drive... I have in my 50 years more then 20 diff. nice good cars... and I have more then 26 years driver lic. and more then 1.000.000 km behind me in all Europe countries... Not like new comer Indian people who use bicycle before and now make so many accident in Doha. Every day I see 5-6 accident. Driver? So sorry just true-Indian.

            <RelCText>Even if you have a International License; you need to get a temporary license from Traffic Department. When you are in Doha; get the application for temporary license and submit it to the Madinat Khalifa Traffic Department along with copy of your US license and passport pages showing your identity and visa page You might need to get an NOC from the sponsor (Typed in Arabic) if you visit here under visa from some company or sponsor. Best way is to ask the rental car company to assist you to get it.</RelCText>

            <RelCText>Supposedly the US license is good for (7) days. An international license is good for (6) months. They are easily obtained from AAA for about $15. After (6) months and likely before then you would need to go for a Qatar drivers license.</RelCText>

            <RelCText>"Ok; I have a cat. But we take him to Pampered Pets whenever we travel. They also board dogs... The do a great job; and I know lots of people who take their animals there. If your dog is social; he can play with the other dogs each day. If not; he can stay by himself. They cater to each individual animal and know them by name. (I'm ""Rackety's owner""-- they know him; not me!) The only catch is that they book up really far in advance. Call as far in advance as you can to book your space.

            <RelCText>You shouldn't be working ANYWHERE in Qatar WITHOUT an NHA license;so continuing in your current job for another year &amp; then showing that to NHA as work experience may not be the best idea because as of now you are working ILLEGALLY!...you need to have minimum 2 years work experience OUTSIDE Qatar before coming here;if you could be employed legally here without an NHA license;what's the point of them conducting the exam???...so if you want to legally work in Qatar;go back to your home country(doesn't matter where as long as you work LEGALLY.);get two years LEGAL work experience then come back here;get your degree;certificates &amp; work experience reviewed by Dataflow;then apply to take the licensure exam...</RelCText>

            <RelCText>I think work experience is not a prerequisite for taking the NHA exam that is now handled by Prometric. You can try to schedule the exam online. However; there's no point of taking the exam without the required work experience since it is one of the requirements to get NHA license. Moreover; if you pass the exam; the validity is only for 2 years; otherwise you have to take it again.</RelCText>

            <RelCText>you can take Prometric exam without experience. My exam's validity is 3 yrs... There are many nurses out there are working without license. Private clinics are very strict on accepting new nurse applicants. Your lucky to practice your profession with license here; but beware my friend...

            <RelCText>again.. they WILL NOT ask you anything. All the procedure of getting visa takes about 2-3 minutes.. they just check your passport; collect the payment (be ready to pay something like QR50; which is about US$15 by credit card); put the stamp in your passprot; and you are IN.. ********** [img_assist|nid=102563|title=QS|desc=|link=none|align=left|width=|height=0] Copyright&#169;Mr.PAUL</RelCText>

Anyone who know more about this or if they even offer flight benefits? I know it is not the most important part of the contract but all other airlines offer it!! Thanks..</RelQBody>

            <RelCText>Each employee is entitled to a free return air ticket within QR network for herself/himself; and her/his family (depending on one's grade). Which class they are entitled to is also dependent on the grade. They are also entitled to purchase discounted tickets; but that is on sub-load basis meaning the the seats are not confirmed and one could be bumped out in the last moment in case flights are full. It's an industry practice.</RelCText>

            <RelCText>Guys; It depends on the nature of the ban. Normally a ban is a no entry situation. If he is having a no entry stamp to Dubai then he will not be able to get visa to any of the GCC countries. The Immigration system of all the other countries will ave details of the person and it will normally block the visa. I know some guys in India unable to get visa to any other GCC countries because of the ban in Dubai.</RelCText>

            <RelCText>Just today i went for the workpermit medical. I think the process works as follows: 1. Your company applies online for WP and you get a piece of paper that it is issued. - Max 1 week. 2. They get a medical date - another week max. 3. Finger printing - another 3-4 days. 4. WP card - another 2-3 days. above days are just from my personal experience and may vary.</RelCText>

            <RelCText>these are two different things.. Tepgam67 is asking about Work permit while being on Family visa. shapil is talking about residence permit. that's what happens when unprofessional people try to give an advice. Tepgam67; if you have an RP here; to obtain a Work permit you need police clearance and the contract certified in MOL. How long it takes to finalize the process depends on several factors. ometimes it takes 3-4 days; sometimes it takes 1 month and even more. If you don't have an RP here (i.e. you are on 6 months family visa); you cannot work; and therefore you cannot obtain a Work permit.</RelCText>

            <RelCText>There is a regulated nursery service in doha but at premium rates and difficult to obtain a place; and now due to new regulations there are a reduced number of places. but with careful search you should be able to find a Nursery place. Do ask to see their Ministry registration. Outside of this there is the home provision by employing a Nanny; which is a costly activity initially. There is also many who will offer the service privately unregulated. Its your choice who you trust this small child with. Child care should be planned proir to the babys birth. we have nine months to plan for this day and children deserve the best decisions from us . check Doha Mums website . good Luck.</RelCText>

            <RelCText>"Do NOT go to Coiffure Francaise. I went in with very curly hair and asked Marie Claire; the hair dresser; to cut off ONE inch. She cut at least two inches off the overall length. I already had long layers and she asked me if I wanted layers and ended up cutting VERY short layers. She also cut the very front much shorter than the rest of my hair and then straightened the whole thing. I can not wear it curly because it looks REALLY bad. I have to spend extra time straightening my hair; and it's not growing quickly at all. I can't put it in a pony tail yet; and she cut it three weeks ago. If you see a girl around Doha that looks like she tried to give herself ""the Rachel"" at home; that's me. :("</RelCText>

            <RelCText>"Carrefour may be cheaper but definitely Jarir has the edge over ""before-sales"" and ""after-sales"" service.

            <RelCText>When it comes to Identical LapTops; Then Carrefour is cheaper; yet that does not mean that Carrefour provides the best choices.[Note: what you buy from them has warrenty]. If you are looking for acertain brand with special specificatins; you might not find it at carrefour... So what you pay for is what you get according to what you want whether in Jarrir ; Carrefour or any other place. We can say one thing: they both are the most popular and saffest to buy from. :-)</RelCText>

            <RelCText>how are you doing girl? well.. Al Massa charges QR1000 for 3 months as I am aware. And if you pay for the whole year; it will cost you something QR2400-2500... unless they increased the fee...I personally like Gym at the Sehati Beauty Mall; as they have the best selection of machines so far; even though it's still way too poor comparing to gyms in Canada; but at least it's better then other gyms... If you need only classes; the best choice is Aspire. BTW; i have never heard of Nero Blanco too..

            <RelCText>Oops! Here I go; the one in the city centre is in the parking lot as described. Their phone number is 4931426 &amp; 4930394. There&#160; is another one in the Centre; where Mega Mart is; near the Ramada. Go inside the building like you would for Mega Mart; but go right; past the Jewellry stands and where LG/Jumbo has their store. The Foot Centre is right next to it. Same company as the one in the City Centre. I do not have their number but you could call the shop in the CC and ask for the number. Both places do male &amp; female and are professionals in the care of feet. They sell the Dr Scholl products &amp; shoes too.&#160; Do make appointment&#160; Aisha-Taweela</RelCText>

            <RelCText>rambee; visit aspire and ask about their evening sports activities. bring your passport or qatar id because you need to register before you could avail of their multifacted sports activities. you pay a minimal fee monthly because aspire is subsidized by the government. some sports they have include boxing; swimming; various ball games; yoga; and others. one good thing about their evening program is that each sports class has a professional instructor dedicated not merely to teach but also to ensure student health and safety. i will go to aspire than enrol in any other chic gym here in qatar.

            <RelCText>So you will be on a business visa until your RP comes through all you have to do is tell your company when you are going and they will apply for a exit visa which is just a piece of paper really saying you are allowed to go and they will also get you the entrance visa for when you come back! You can go wher you like just remember to check if you need a visa for the other countries you wish to visit!

            <RelCText>No on a business visa you can fly out as many times as you wish so that just might be a company thing iam on a business visa and so are three of my friends one being a south african like yourself and we fly out for weekends all the time!

            <RelCText>You used to be able to pay it online at the e-Government site but that's been under maintenance for a long time now.

            <RelCText>I've been there only once; but I can't remember the place. It is kind of tricky and not that easy to be found. I tried to post earlier but I was disconnected and it seems that my post is not here. Man you can pay at any time but before renewing your car registration. When you go for that they will ask you to clear all the violations that you got. First time I hear about the 10% thing; might be a new thing but never hear of it. The guys are right as well as the Airport one is less crowded than the Khalifa branch. You can also pay for that in 'Giant Stores' or 'Villagio' as I remember. I saw an office there for the Traffic Department. There is also in 'Hammad Hospital' down there near the Parking area down there. It is empty all the time. Good Luck</RelCText>

            <RelCText>1. Normally the ban period in case of resignation &amp; cancellation of VISA is 2yrs... 2. But incase of your wife; she can ask from her company to issue NOC to her stating that her company won't object while she transfers her company visa to husband visa..There is no need for her to even exit QATAR.. Incase; if her company doesn't willing to give her NOC and no transfer of VISA; she can leave QATAR and can come back on HUSBAND VISA provided that you(husband)should meet all the norms and criteria that is normally required once applying for FAMILY VISA...You should be earning a salary of around QR7000 or more than that..</RelCText>

            <RelCText>A couple of things you need to know... If you arrived here on a business visa from Phil; and then you went on to your company sponsorship; then you are not classed as a local recruit. So... your employer does not have to give you NOC. Next thing... even if your employer gives you NOC; you will be able to transfer your sponsorship to another employer for at least one year. The rules as I know are that you should complete 2 years with your employer before you can transfer. But; normally after a year Labour will transfer the sponsorship Think about this twice before you go ahead. Hope this helps with making your decision :o)</RelCText>

            <RelCText>sometimes you'll find perfumes with a name but in a plain bottle. They're not knockoffs; basically they are arabic style perfumes (the mix) but with a similarity to the perfume on the label. __________________________ Cost of Living; Visas; Safety Info; Tips; Pics; Vids and m</RelCText>

            <RelCText>I used to buy perfumes from this retailer; I bought hugo boss from highland and then i bought the same one from this guy... both of them smelled the same and lasted for the same amount of time.

            <RelCText>If the company has available visa for your nationality; teh2008 is right you can get it in a day or two. But there are factors why your visa has not been released yet; e.g. the PRO is lazy; the PRO is on vacation; no visa approval yet; the position is on hold; other internal factors from your employer or agent etc. Better confirm again with your agent in the Phils. to remind the employer:)</RelCText>

            <RelCText>Hi All. I used Mr. Kabeer for my recent move within Doha. His price was very reasonable; a third of the price of the major moving companies. They packed everything up for me. I had to organise my own boxes which I did from QMart at the Mall; and they put all my stuff into them for me. They were quite careful with my stuff and no serious damage was incurred; but I had to supervise that they packed the fragile items carefully; and instruct them on what to put in each box. I strongly recommend him; but as with any move; supervise that the valuables and fragiles items are packed carefully or even better; by yourself. Also; be on hand to manage the packing.</RelCText>

            <RelCText>After reading your comments; I thought I'd give Mr Kabeer a ring yesterday. He arranged to come over... and I waited for 5 hours for him. When I tried to ring him to find out where he was; he didn't answer - I called four times. Then today he rang and said he was outside my place - apart from the fact that I'm working today and he's 24 hours late.... Hardly reliable; so just as well I'm not taking him On the upside; I tried Runway International. They turned up on time; took 10 minutes assessing everything and asking all the right questions... they may be more expensive than Kabeer; but at least they'll show up!</RelCText>

            <RelCText>hey guys; seeing there's a few climbing nuts aside of me. i've been scouting out some good bouldering and deep water soloing spots but only through internet cos i'm not actually in qatar yet...from the images i've found; seems there's some nice climeable rock a couple hours' drive out of doha. if any of you would like to tag along and go take a peak once i'm there; i'm sure if we put our heads together we can find a few respectable crags to keep going.. anyways keep me posted. would be nice to meet a few fellow climbers. cheers; K</RelCText>

            <RelQSubject>Visa for Dubai for Qatar RP Holder</RelQSubject>
            <RelQBody>I have heard that it&amp;#39;s really fun to drive from Qatar to Dubai on the weekend (obviosly if you have a 4 X 4 Drive). My question is do I need to get a visa if I want to go to Dubai if I have a Residence Permit of Qatar?</RelQBody>

            <RelCText>Although you can go to dubai and get visa on arrival if you are going by air but road travel is different. You have to pass Saudi border and you need saudi visa. In order to get saudi visa you have to get UAE visa first. Saudi gives visa only after you already have UAE visa on your passport. Hope this clarifies.</RelCText>

            <RelCText>well for UAE visa you will have to go 3 times to the embassy. But for saudi transit visa just go to the agent and you will get it stamped in 5days.</RelCText>

            <RelCText>You will need to get a transit visa for her with a no objection letter to the Saudi Embassy typed in Arabic. You will need to get her a Visa from UAE Embassy here in Qatar before you travel. She will not be issue a visa on Arrival. I suggest just leave her home</RelCText>

            <RelQBody>My wife I want to drive to the UAE; next month. I understand about the visa situation; and I can cope with that. My question is: Am I allowed to drive out of Qatar in my car that I have not finished paying for from the bank? My friend told me he seems to remember hearing that it was not possible; and that somehow; they know this at the border and will not allow me to leave. Can anyone confirm this? Thanks for your help.

            <RelCText>So to answer the question; i'm not certain if you are inquiring about Airlines policy or government visa policy.... If its the former; best thing to do is call QATAR AIRWAYS and ask them. If it's the latter; then maybe there's a government agency you can ask? When my daughter was born (here in Doha); she didn't travel till she was 6 months old; but we were told the law was that she had to have a residency Visa within a month of being born....so by the time she travelled she had it. Hope that helps somewhat; and good luck. Stay safe all. Perfection does not exist. The question therefore; is: what level of imperfection are we willing to settle for?</RelCText>

            <RelCText>for the visa; better get it before the travel to avoid furture hassles. but i would suggest that you let the baby grow old a few months more before you take him/her travelling on an airplane. just imagine even an adult do have some problms with air pressure inside the cabin of an aircraft; what more would a few weeks old or a month old baby feel about this? (he/she'll be crying all the way to your destination) if that's the case.</RelCText>

            <RelCText>when he traveled for the first time.... As per doctor's advice and as Novita said; I gave him a bottle of milk during take off and landing...and everything was ok... Just make sure to issue him passport and stamp the ikama (RP) on it before you travel.</RelCText>

            <RelCText>i bought my baby girl when she was three weeks old. she is now healthy and fine. i normaly assume the baby can travel after two weeks from qatar airways. you have to feed baby during take off and landing to avoid pressure diffrence. and should keep your hands clean (by wet wipes) before you touch the baby to avoid contamination. visa can be obtained on arrival for the baby.</RelCText>
