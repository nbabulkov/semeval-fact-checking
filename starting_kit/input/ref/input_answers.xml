			<RelCText>If you have been invited for interview in Doha; it's likely (in my opinion) that you will be made an offer. The two days will allow enough time for you to undergo a medical; meet other staff/management; have a look around Doha; at housing available etc. Good luck.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>the interviewing department will endorse their evaluation about you to HR.

			<RelCText>It depends what you have had already. You don't specifically need any extra vaccinations as long as you are up to date with the usual ones you have in the UK (not sure about US) but you can have Rabies as optional if you want. Although there is no requirement or need to have any extra protection here; it is important to remember that lots of people travel East on holidays and if you do you will need the standard typhoid; yellow fever; etc. Children need to have been vaccinated against TB before they can start school. In the UK they no longer give BCG so important to get that done before you come.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>As I said; the official advice is that you don't HAVE to; however; they may offer you Rabies; Typhoid and Hep B as an option. As they no longer boost Tetanus as routine; you would have to have a booster before coming. That said; the UK has a vey hands off approach to immunisation at the moment as most diseases are sufficiently covered by herd immunity (where because the majority have been vaccinated the people who haven't are covered to a large extent) and cases are low. Personally as long as there is a low risk; I would have all the vaccinations I could; why not?</RelCText>

			<RelCText>In 2006 it was a lovely winter. It was dark; cloudy and rained for almost every day in December. We got trapped in Doha on new years eve and were unable to get to Dukhan such was the torrential rain. It rained on and off until April and then warmed up. The coldest night was 5C but generally 7C. I remember it rained when my parents were here and that was April 2007. This last winter wasn't very cold at all; only a few days of rain and never really got below 10C at night. I love winters here; they are so cosy. On the down side; houses are not built for winter so prepare to freeze and get leaks driping everywhere. The roads don't drain very well so very wet.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>"While car seats are available in Qatar; they're bound to be pricier than the ones you have already; and the selection will not exactly ""wow"" you. Unfortunately I can't tell you what brands are available here since I haven't paid them any attention. I brought my two Britax Boulevards with us from the U.S. and they came through fine. I do recommend purchasing car seat travel bags if you can find them in Norway because it will definitely help keep the cloth cover in better shape. If you can't find them; though; the airline will put it in a very heavy-duty plastic bag. Hope that helps; Expat Sue&#241;o P.S. I am starting a Mums and Kids group here in Doha for expats. Be sure to get in touch with me when you arrive (or before if you have any questions).

The driver of the car Eric was in was in an accident..another driver had run a red light and side swiped their car. Eric was the only one rushed to the hopital.

			<RelCText>Hi; I am sure most of the guyz answered your query; if you need more details; read the follwoing: The role of the red blood cells is to carry oxygen through the body. The red blood cells can perform this task because of the presence of hemoglobin; the pigment that is formed when the red blood cells develop in the bone marrow. Each hemoglobin molecule is made up of a protein molecule called globin and four pigmented molecules of a compound called heme. Each heme molecule has one atom of iron; and there are four heme molecules in a single molecule of hemoglobin; hence; a single molecule of hemoglobin has four atoms of iron. This structure makes it possible for one hemoglobin molecule to join with four oxygen molecules to form a substance called oxyhemoglobin. This reaction is reversible; enabling hemoglobin to pick up oxygen when the blood is in the lungs and to release oxygen in the cells when the blood is pumped to the tissues. In general; the blood of men usually has a greater concent.....</RelCText>

			<RelCText>"Hemoglobin is a protein that is carried by red cells. It picks up oxygen in the lungs and delivers it to the peripheral tissues to maintain the viability of cells. Hemoglobin is made from two similar proteins that ""stick together"". Both proteins must be present for the hemoglobin to pick up and release oxygen normally. One of the component proteins is called alpha; the other is beta. Before birth; the beta protein is not expressed. A hemoglobin protein found only during fetal development; called gamma; substitutes up until birth."</RelCText>

			<RelCText>NO. you cant drive with other then GCC license. I also think that I can but law is clear. You need to make all procedure to exchange or make Qatari an driving license. Be sure all stories that you can drive is wrong. If you make any accident then you will see the problems. Best wishes. p.s. if you go to make driving license and you fall...make like I was...give to Sudani man big boss there some money and this is it. I give 1000 QAR and in 3 time I get licence. This is not secret just life in Doha. Corruption every where. Can you imagine that I fall 2 times at driving tests like I dont know how to drive... I have in my 50 years more then 20 diff. nice good cars... and I have more then 26 years driver lic. and more then 1.000.000 km behind me in all Europe countries... Not like new comer Indian people who use bicycle before and now make so many accident in Doha. Every day I see 5-6 accident. Driver? So sorry just true-Indian.

If your dog is social; he can play with the other dogs each day. If not; he can stay by himself. They cater to each individual animal and know them by name.

I would recommend you to join RasGas; where you get a Annual Ticket Fares (whether you go or not; you actually get around 4;000 more); get a Paid Annual Vacation (recieve your salary even when you are on Holidays for those Expenses); accomodation provided with free electricity and local phone call bills; and TOO much more benefits. For a Mechanical Engineer will be around QAR 26;000. And you also get to live in a world-class peaceful community; Also known as the Al Khor Community; with families of Qatargas' and Rasgas' Employees. All the benefits in RasGas are also provided in QatarGas; but RasGas has a bit more higher salary and you get monthly trips to Sealine beach resort for Quad-biking and Jet skiing; and also get PSP's; expensive mobile phones etc. Hope you get a good job and hope i've .....</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Each employee is entitled to a free return air ticket within QR network for herself/himself; and her/his family (depending on one's grade). Which class they are entitled to is also dependent on the grade. They are also entitled to purchase discounted tickets; but that is on sub-load basis meaning the the seats are not confirmed and one could be bumped out in the last moment in case flights are full.

If he is having a no entry stamp to Dubai then he will not be able to get visa to any of the GCC countries.

How long it takes to finalize the process depends on several factors. ometimes it takes 3-4 days; sometimes it takes 1 month and even more. If you don't have an RP here (i.e. you are on 6 months family visa); you cannot work; and therefore you cannot obtain a Work permit.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>There is a regulated nursery service in doha but at premium rates and difficult to obtain a place; and now due to new regulations there are a reduced number of places. but with careful search you should be able to find a Nursery place. Do ask to see their Ministry registration. Outside of this there is the home provision by employing a Nanny; which is a costly activity initially. There is also many who will offer the service privately unregulated. Its your choice who you trust this small child with. Child care should be planned proir to the babys birth. we have nine months to plan for this day and children deserve the best decisions from us . check Doha Mums website . good Luck.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>"Do NOT go to Coiffure Francaise. I went in with very curly hair and asked Marie Claire; the hair dresser; to cut off ONE inch. She cut at least two inches off the overall length. I already had long layers and she asked me if I wanted layers and ended up cutting VERY short layers. She also cut the very front much shorter than the rest of my hair and then straightened the whole thing. I can not wear it curly because it looks REALLY bad. I have to spend extra time straightening my hair; and it's not growing quickly at all. I can't put it in a pony tail yet; and she cut it three weeks ago.

			<RelCText>When it comes to Identical LapTops; Then Carrefour is cheaper; yet that does not mean that Carrefour provides the best choices.[Note: what you buy from them has warrenty]. If you are looking for acertain brand with special specificatins; you might not find it at carrefour... So what you pay for is what you get according to what you want whether in Jarrir ; Carrefour or any other place. We can say one thing: they both are the most popular and saffest to buy from. :-)</RelCText>
