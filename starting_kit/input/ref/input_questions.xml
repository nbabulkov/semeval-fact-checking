            <RelCText>I was catching fish before on corniche and if i show you some of the photos you would not believe me. Now everything on Corniche is banned. No Fishing; No Playing Football; No Bikes; No setting on the grass and ... I don't know what is next. You can go to 'Khour El Edid' and see there. Actually on those open places there is no guarantee all the time. Even the area near the Ritz Carlton that we were going there before like 7 years [we were fulling 2 big Coleman Fridges which comes sometimes 12KG] it is now band. Good luck and if you know a new place; plz tell me. :)</RelCText>

            <RelCText>I went snorkelling two days ago off the coast of Dukhan; about 2 km to the right of the Water Sports Club; near to the Desalination plant. Some massive rocks and colourless coral but there were quite a few different types of fish there; including some HUGE angel fish; very very nice spot. and yes... the jelly fish are here now!!!</RelCText>

            <RelCText>"Best places are Fuwarait beach - swim striaght out and there are lots of corals; different fish; sea greass beds and sea snakes. If your really lucky turtles. Anywhere north of Ras Laffan should be good. I was at Umm Tais Natural Reserves (mentioned in post above - turn right at Al-Shammal and head east; first island is Ras Rakkan and is harder to get to; go past until a hamlet and past this you can access Umm Tais) a few weeks ago; interesting place but Fuwarait is easier to get to etc. ""Sandy"" beach we used to go to; Al-Dhakriah mangroves. There is generally less to see on west coast than the east coast unless you go to places near construction which for the east coast is now a lot!! Hence i recommend French beach / fuwarait. There are also a few nice locations you can snorkell in the inland sea; although currents at certain times are very very strong. GO past coastguard station at mouth and head along towards Saudi until you see obvious shallows."</RelCText>

            <RelCText>From what you all have said; Fuwarait beach is a perfect place to explore; to enjoy and witness its natural reserves. Thanks for the share!

            <RelCText>I was interviewed for Senior shift supervisor job but the system they have is not exist else where in the world so in their requriments they require shift supervisor in large utilities even it's not the same like the one they have from this point the interview was not good cause we do not have the same background ( me and the interviewer ) so i think the interviewer evaluation will be negative.</RelCText>

            <RelCText>It depends what you have had already. You don't specifically need any extra vaccinations as long as you are up to date with the usual ones you have in the UK (not sure about US) but you can have Rabies as optional if you want. Although there is no requirement or need to have any extra protection here; it is important to remember that lots of people travel East on holidays and if you do you will need the standard typhoid; yellow fever; etc. Children need to have been vaccinated against TB before they can start school. In the UK they no longer give BCG so important to get that done before you come.</RelCText>

            <RelCText>Also; if you have been vaccinated against HepB; tell them when you have your blood test as you will show as having antibodies. there was a thread about this a while ago; ask Apple for advice; she is the expert here.</RelCText>

            <RelCText>I didn't have any vaccinations before coming here from the Netherlands... Doctors also didn't advise me to take any. I think you should be good as long as you have had the ones you had as a child. And even if you didn't; your body has an immune system so it will be able to fight off the most not so serious diseases. TB would be smart to have though!</RelCText>

            <RelCText>As I said; the official advice is that you don't HAVE to; however; they may offer you Rabies; Typhoid and Hep B as an option. As they no longer boost Tetanus as routine; you would have to have a booster before coming. That said; the UK has a vey hands off approach to immunisation at the moment as most diseases are sufficiently covered by herd immunity (where because the majority have been vaccinated the people who haven't are covered to a large extent) and cases are low. Personally as long as there is a low risk; I would have all the vaccinations I could; why not?</RelCText>

            <RelCText>Yes you can bring it but be careful this kind of dog is very very very dangerous. Because I have one that my friend brought it to my last year from Kuwait. You can talk to Doha Airport to be sure about that.</RelCText>

            <RelCText>Bring the normal clothes that you are wearing in Philippines. November is still a nice weather...not so hot nor cold. But on December to early February; it will be winter and you need some winter clothes; but not the thick ones. The jacket that we usually used on the cold rainy season will do as weather is not extremely cold in Qatar. It is still manageable. Don't bring too much clothes; you can buy from Qatar whenever you want to. There are clothe shops that are affordable and there is always on sale items.</RelCText>

            <RelCText>In 2006 it was a lovely winter. It was dark; cloudy and rained for almost every day in December. We got trapped in Doha on new years eve and were unable to get to Dukhan such was the torrential rain. It rained on and off until April and then warmed up. The coldest night was 5C but generally 7C. I remember it rained when my parents were here and that was April 2007. This last winter wasn't very cold at all; only a few days of rain and never really got below 10C at night. I love winters here; they are so cosy. On the down side; houses are not built for winter so prepare to freeze and get leaks driping everywhere. The roads don't drain very well so very wet.</RelCText>

            <RelCText>Well; it is 3% in the first year anyway. I think the insurance companies might have agreements with the insurance carriers and direct buyers to a particular insurance agency. Invariably you will return to the insurance company you used when you bought the car. When the annual renewal comes up though you may find that it is way higher than 3%! Or else we weren't skilled/persistent enough to negotiate it down to 3% :) Here is a short blog about our experience with car insurance renewal. http://tinyurl.com/elmrk from my blog about life in Qatar: http://www.xanga.com/BBetz</RelCText>

            <RelCText>Car Insurance is quite different from Western practices. As noted above; you insure the car; not the driver; which is one of the reasons kids here can afford to drive massive landcruisers; despite the slaughter of pedestrians. (Blood money for non-Moslems is pretty minimal; anyway.) For cars over a certain age; (2 years? Dunno) 3rd party is the only option. however; and again as noted above; cover for passengers is not automatic so check these things carefully with your Insurance Broker. Even the possibility of having residual alocohol in your bloodstream when some idiot slams into you some morning has to be specifically covered; so it's not a bad idea to go to a reputable international Insurance company if you think you might occasionally have non-family passengers or drink beer of an evening.</RelCText>

            <RelCText>When you take out full insurance; you will normally be offered the choice of insuring the driver and ex-number (you chose) of passengers. Additionally; as stated; you can insure against being over the limit (excess alcohol); although I do not know what would happen if a driver was drunk and had an accident.</RelCText>

            <RelCText>"in this region subscribe to. But in the end; it's just a stupid rationalization for not doing what would keep your children safe. Especially in light of recent stats on road injuries per capita in Qatar (""Qatar suffered four times more injuries in road accidents per 100;000 people than the second-placed country; Kuwait; and tied with South Africa for the most road deaths; the report shows.""); you'd think they might want to start enforcing the laws on the books. I feel sorry for the kids who have these people as parents. But I guess it's just Social Darwinism in action.

            <RelCText>There's an unenforced law where children under 10 need to be in the backseat. There's no law to where children need to be strapped into child safety seats. There's no awareness.

            <RelCText>"While car seats are available in Qatar; they're bound to be pricier than the ones you have already; and the selection will not exactly ""wow"" you. Unfortunately I can't tell you what brands are available here since I haven't paid them any attention. I brought my two Britax Boulevards with us from the U.S. and they came through fine. I do recommend purchasing car seat travel bags if you can find them in Norway because it will definitely help keep the cloth cover in better shape. If you can't find them; though; the airline will put it in a very heavy-duty plastic bag. Hope that helps; Expat Sue&#241;o P.S. I am starting a Mums and Kids group here in Doha for expats. Be sure to get in touch with me when you arrive (or before if you have any questions).

            <RelCText>"This is one of my pet peaves...back home (Houston; Texas) children;according to their age; must be in a car seat. Knowing that this law does not exist here and how upset I would get; my husband warned me before hand; ""Now; you're gonna see a lot of children that should be in car seats and they're not."" NOT having children in carseats; in the event of an accident; can lead to paralysis or even death. Everyone should wear their safety belts. SAD STORY: (I was a high school teacher) One of my students; Eric; had just earned a full football scholarship to the University of Texas. One night; he was in the backseat of a mid-size car and had fallen asleep and was not wearing his seat belt. The driver of the car Eric was in was in an accident..another driver had run a red light and side swiped their car. Eric was the only one rushed to the hopital. The others had been wearing their seatbelts and were not injured. Eric was paralyzed. Consequently; he was not able to play ball for UT. The UT law....."</RelCText>

            <RelCText>"Amen. Nothing is more important and I believe that you and the others that utilize their car seats for their little ones (and big ones for that matter) are setting a great example...maybe it will actually ""catch on"" here! ;) Sad Memory: I remember getting to the hospital that night after another teacher called with the news. The rest of the family was there as well...how tragic...in time; the news spread of how a fellow classmate; a close friend to many; was not going to be able to walk and play ball. Others vowed to ""buckle up"" as we say in south Texas. They had learned a hard lesson. If this story helps even one person remember to take the time to use seatbelts/car seats...it was worth sharing. The Good News: He went on to complete his degree from UT. I last heard he was in law school with hopes of becoming a lawyer specializing in defending rights for the disabled."</RelCText>

            <RelCText>"was perhaps 2 days ago. At the Traffic lights at Hyatt Plaza a vehicle over took me and pulled in front of me at the red lights. As i looked into the car in front i could see a child of no more than two years old asleep on the back shelf; facing the window. Even my daughter who is four said"" look at that silly baby"" Ive not seen a collsion yet where the backend of the vehicle and rear window hasnt been smashed.

            <RelQSubject>Wakra Beach</RelQSubject>
            <RelQBody>Hi everybody As everybody know; that beach is just a big dump of trash. Why we don't organize some kind off group that could take care; clean and protect the beach. Do anybody know where to start; and do we need authorization from the Government to take some action; like grade and clean the beach? Some money will be needed; if there is a start point I can participate with 1000 rials. Maybe it seams like a crazy idea; but Qatar deserve it; not just come here and take the money</RelQBody>

            <RelCText>There WAS a ton of garbage in the spring; but not sure how clean it is now. Canadian School organized an environment day to clean-up the beach in May 07.

            <RelCText>I go there almost every weekend; cause I plan to do some Kite There are broken glasses; bottles; tires; carpets; plastic bags everywhere; month of May is long gone. I think renting a heavy machine to grade; and remove all the trash; was a morning job; and everybody will profit it. Is unbelievable; the amount of broken plastic chairs; and stuff you can find there. I think the beach deserve our respect and protection; I'm not criticizing; but the damage is done; and action and not words need to be taken; every time I go there I bring my trash; and some times pick some plastic bottles around. Now there is a big dump of sand; maybe for construction. In a Country almost like an Island; not having a proper beach to go; is a shame. I can use Hotels; but to be honest for example the beach of the Resort in Messaid is worst; not only the trash but boats and jet skis like fly's. Check mate.....</RelCText>

            <RelCText>that everyone feels it is the job of expats to clean up this country and the role of the locals to trash it in the first place. I for one ALWAYS pack out my garbage; always bury and disperse my campfire and practice zero impact camping and picnicking. I know many others that do the same but the amount of litter I've seen thrown out the window of Landcruisers suggests that prevention needs to be seen as the biggest part of the solution. Please don't try to lay guilt trips on me for these ones. When I start to see convoys of Qataris taking pride in and cleaning up their own country (and not paying Sri Lankans a pittance to do it for them); I'll gladly stop and lend a hand. -- Since Allah has given me a brain; it would seem like a sin not to use it.</RelCText>

Good to know people like rassadko feel that we should do something for this place; but its not going to change with just some cleaning up process once in a way; we need to have people patrol the place and fine them on the spot whenever they are seen littering.Unless; some strict measures which apply both to the locals and residents apply; this country will not improve.</RelCText>

            <RelCText>beach to clean ... the constructions going there took care of everything and cleaned the beach of everything even the sand. These guys never have a dull moment; doing constructions everywhere and damaging more than constructing. Wait for another 2 years and there would be no need to clean the beach; the cleaning staff would do the rest and you had to pay to visit the beach :( Do not dwell in the past; do not dream of the future; concentrate the mind on the present moment.

            <RelCText>hello there; as i do live in dukhan for quite long time; i don't recommend you camping at um bab beach. nothing serious about it but normally people don't camp there!plus safety wise your gonna be far away from dukhan if you need assistance.not good location too i guess around there to camp; but just wanted to let you know since you've asked; you could try further down dukhans beach after the beach house (after the QP sailing club)if you know what i mean good clean spots you could always find. anyways good luck mate have fun!</RelCText>

            <RelCText>Nissan is a rip off; get your car fixed outside for fraction of the price. To fix your ac they will tell you ten other items need to be replaced; plus labour charges and you will end up keeping your car with them for a week or so. For 20k you can buy another second hand car :P</RelCText>

            <RelCText>Make sure you don't use to small or too large a pot for your house plants; I have kept plants in their same container for 10 years and they are fine depends on the plant.&#160; Also you mentioned manure; you don't use manure on indoor plants; I hope you meant soil. I also use a liquid fertilizer once in a&#160; while and I save water bottles and fill with water and leave for my house plants that way the chlorine goes out and the temp is room temperature when you water once a week.&#160; Sometimes the plants you get here are not good quality when you buy them so it doesn't take much to kill them.&#160; I had gardenias in the house and within a few months they had outgrown the pot; root bound so I planted them outside in a big pot and they are great now.

The red blood cells can perform this task because of the presence of hemoglobin; the pigment that is formed when the red blood cells develop in the bone marrow. Each hemoglobin molecule is made up of a protein molecule called globin and four pigmented molecules of a compound called heme. Each heme molecule has one atom of iron; and there are four heme molecules in a single molecule of hemoglobin; hence; a single molecule of hemoglobin has four atoms of iron. This structure makes it possible for one hemoglobin molecule to join with four oxygen molecules to form a substance called oxyhemoglobin. This reaction is reversible; enabling hemoglobin to pick up oxygen when the blood is in the lungs and to release oxygen in the cells when the blood is pumped to the tissues. In general; the blood of men usually has a greater concent.....</RelCText>

            <RelCText>"Hemoglobin is a protein that is carried by red cells. It picks up oxygen in the lungs and delivers it to the peripheral tissues to maintain the viability of cells. Hemoglobin is made from two similar proteins that ""stick together"". Both proteins must be present for the hemoglobin to pick up and release oxygen normally. One of the component proteins is called alpha; the other is beta. Before birth; the beta protein is not expressed.

            <RelCText>hello guys;Im a filipino physiotherapist. parents should not be ashamed of having a child with special needs.If they dont do something about the condition of their child;they deprived the rights their child to have an education. In the Philippines there are more schools that caters children with special needs.If we educate them;they can be independent in time as they grow old. Try to search for the movie I am Sam;its about a father with mild mental retardation who nurtura and love his child.He works a lot to earn for a living to help him send her child to school and to have better future. This is a touching and heart pounding story how a mental challenged father strive to have her little girl. Hope you like this film.</RelCText>

            <RelQBody>I was very surprised to see Scientology - trying to get converts in Qatar This belief system is banned in some countries such as Germany (i think) and the founder openly ridicules Islam. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZbT6bQi-1bw The founder's books are available at the book fair - near the AWQAF (ministry of islam) stand....at the front entrance.

According to tradition; in 339 BC a brilliant waxing moon save Byzantium (now Istanbul) from attack by Philip of Macedon. To mark their gratitude; the citizens adopted the Crescent of Diana as the city's emblem. When the city became the Christian Constantinople in 330 AD; its Crescent assumed the significance of an attribute of the Virgin Mary. In 1299; conquering what is now Turkey; Sultan Osman had a vision of a crescent moon stretching over the world; it thus became a symbol of the Ottoman dynasty; and when Constantinople fell to Muhammad II in 1453; the crescent came to represent both Islam and the Turkish empire. The star was added by Sultan Selim III in 1793 (its five points being established in 1844)."" Source : ""Signs &amp; Symbols; page 42; by Clare Gibson"</RelCText>

            <RelCText>LewisHamilton; Here is an honest report: Be prepared to often put your patience levels beyond your limits in many daily situations. The driving here is insane and extremely risky. The professionalism levels are quite substandard when compared to the developed world. Services here are generally very poor. You will witness all around you; extremisms of social segregation and exclusion; where laborers and maids are marginalized and excluded from the main stream society. During the summer months (May to September) the heat is extreme; it can reach + 50 C. Many people leave Qatar and those who stay; stay indoors. During those months; life is all about work; home and shopping malls. No rain and sand storms instead. Your home and car will be covered with fine brown dust (as thin as cement or talc powder) when can damage your electronic appliances and your health. You'll always have to be aware and think of how not to offend (such as what you wear; what you say; what you drink and eat and when.....</RelCText>

Beaches here look nice in pictures but often there are not that great (mainly because of the sand which is earthy dusty and the extreme heat starting in May.

Recently they have built a series of artificial beaches; between the Intercontinental and the Pearl; in Qatara (a cultural village partially operating). The beaches are prepared to be public but they are subjected to a cover fee. All these beaches are artificial so expect dusty sand and sea bed with construction debris.

            <RelCText>Dukhan is about 100 km (correct me if I'm wrong) from Doha...take the new road; it's unter construction but already good and ver smooth; much better than the old one. You go to education city and then just follow the signs to Dukhan.

            <RelQBody>I know that inline skating; jogging; biking ect... are ok basically anywhere in Doha but skaeboarding always seems to get a bad wrap wherever I go.&#160; Is this the same in Doha?&#160; Im not talking about destroying property or anything like that but it is often view that way while im simply entertaing myself&#160;the same as the rest.&#160; Please do not suggest dune surfing; that looks like all of 5 seconds of fun.&#160; Thanks all!</RelQBody>

            <RelCText>Doha has an overdone of sporting facilities! The Doha Asian Games are next year which means there are a lot of sporting facilities and events happening. Also; there are a number of sport and health clubs that you can join. Soccer is big here and the season is starting soon. Qatar has a number of big names playing in the local league (usually end of career European and South American players who are lurred by the big bucks).

            <RelCText>I personally think there's lots for a teenager to do here. I think it's mostly like most western countries with the exception of all the bad influences (No alcohol in grocery stores and such). Apart from the sports that have been mentioned a billion times; there are a lot of other ones that anyone may join and most of the time get coaching for free. Golf; archery; shooting and a lot of other ones that are completely free. For the not so sport oriented teen; there's the Scientific Club which is like a club that allows members to expand their scientific abilities. The Scientific Club will die out soon as the new Science and Technology park is opening up soon and lots of major corprations such as Microsoft and Dell are taking part in it. Movies aren't half bad either. The real blockbusters make it here within a week; while other not-so-good ones make it here in 2-3 weeks. There's also Alladin's Kingdom which is an OK theme park. Isn't as great as many others but it's OK. This won't last l.....</RelCText>

            <RelCText>day you can hang with friends for the Christmas Dinner. You can decorate the house as we western people usually doing with Christmas tree; decoration around the house; Christmas flower; prepare a nice dinner (all the big hypermarket has nice special food for Christmas event.....even pork now in QDC).There are also many restaurants arranged a Christmas dinner with decoration; special food etc etc. We have spent 4 Christmas here and everytimes we got fun. Qatar is a boring place if you don't have friend or initiative but could be very interesting and full of fun if you are active person. Merry Christmas</RelCText>

            <RelQSubject>Things to do in Qatar for Eid</RelQSubject>
            <RelQBody>Hey! My husband and I have a week off next week and we have decided to stay in Qatar for the week. Does anyone have any suggestions for things to do? We have out own transport (it is a 4x4; but we're not too adventurous when it comes to venturing off road!!) Along with suggestions; your reviews; prices and directions where you can would also be appreciated! We want to spend the week as tourists; rather than expats; so all advice appreciated. Thanks :D Jayne</RelQBody>

            <RelCText>"TATA are known to be a business house with solid Ethics.. TATA cars have proven to be success in Indian MArket. There Indica was the only car in India which challenged the dominance of Maruti Suzuki 800; which was enjoying the maximum market share. TATA NANO has shown to the world their Engineering superiority. Something even the Germans or Japanese Couldn Do. Safari is a Good Vehicle. But the problem in Qatar is - People are not hardworking enough to actually see which vehicle does well on road... They follow the crowd... n Also there is blind following of American Brands n Japanese... You sell a toy car labelled ""made in America"" And the so called Qataries will buy tht in Whole sale.. to boasts About tht fact tht they own American Stuff.... Why you think Skoda is not a much accepted brad here very much like TATA.... First see the vehicle and then Comment.... If a vehicle can run on Indian Roads (sorry not roads.. supposedly roads) It can drive in any country ;... trust me...."</RelCText>

            <RelCText>Yup; just got Titanium done last week after having a Pathfinder for two years. Makes a big difference and got it done for QR1700 and in 45 minutes. Very friendly and I went back the next day as thought I had bubbles in the windscreen. Hate to say it but they were right as disappeared after a week. Good luck; I got ours because of a newborn as well. Now if only someone could invent something that turned on the air con in the car 5 minutes before you get would be a wonderful combination.</RelCText>

            <RelCText>The way I look at it is like this. My child is enrolled in a Western school. My child is not Muslim. Of course he should learn about Islam; but not as something he needs to submit to; but something he should have knowledge about. The same goes for Sharia law. We do indeed live in an Islamic country; so it is important to be familiar with Islam. I like that Arabic is taught; the more languages a person knows;the better.

            <RelCText>Isobel said R.E ... In order to teach religion effectively there has to be comparatives. What I mean by this; when explaining to children the various nuances of religious beliefs one has to show a comparative and what that comparative means to that particular religion. If we are going to go down the route of teaching religion in this country we are going to have teach ALL religions; in order to get the history; culture and meanings of what each religion means to that particular one and how in some cases some religions are tied to each other through geographical circumstances and culture and how indeed they came to be that Religion. There will have to be healthy debate and in some cases at High School level; debate as in e.g. Islam and Christianity. Would that work? I think in ex-pat schools it may but in some local private schools; I doubt it. However; if by religious education they mean telling a few stories from Koran to incite a healthy interest in the local religion; it could work......</RelCText>

            <RelCText>"I can't think of a good argument against learning the language of one's host nation (provided; as Isobel said; that a student can handle the academic rigors of such a class). Sharia? I'd personally have a problem with that being mandatory. Because Sharia is a code of law based upon a specific religion; it would only be acceptable to me if it were taught as an elective comparative law class; say; for high school students. Then it would be appropriate. If instead of Sharia; you meant they should be teaching all children Islamiyat/Islamic Studies classes; then you'd get a vehement NO from me. Unless you're going to couch it in a ""comparative religion"" class that EVERYONE has to take; then why should my child have to sit through a class that will amount to nothing more than religious indoctrination to a faith that I don't subscribe to? I would be more than happy for my child to take a class on ""history of the Middle East and the Islamic World"" or ""Arab cultural studies"" (and much like an A....."</RelCText>

            <RelCText>"The chicken or the egg causality dilemma arises from the expression ""which came first; the chicken or the egg?"" Chickens hatch from eggs; but eggs are laid by chickens; making it difficult to say which originally gave rise to the other. To ancient philosophers; the question about the first chicken or egg also evoked the questions of how life and the universe in general began. 1 Cultural references to the chicken and egg intend to point out the futility of identifying the first case of a circular cause and consequence."</RelCText>

            <RelCText>"In a manner of avoiding the question or joking; it can be said that ""the chicken"" came first&#8212;in the structure of the question; simply because the words ""the chicken"" are said before the words ""the egg"" when the question is asked. In a question that is phrased differently; the answer would be different. Similarly; Randy Garner jokingly refers to an encyclopedic solution:[18] &#8220; These supporters call attention to the Merriam-Webster Collegiate Dictionary (2001). Upon careful examination of the entries and accompanying definitions; one can accurately assert that &#8220;chicken&#8221; is found on page 232; while &#8220;egg&#8221; is not found until page 398.

            <RelCText>First prepare yourself and ignore the police when he shout so you don't feel nervous. Make sure you don't knock over any pole. Begin Reverse 2 inches away from the pole in your right hand side. When you don't see the first corner of the pole of the parking box covers by the part of the car; take a full turn to the right. Adjust your mirror on the left hand side down to see the white line; then reverse slowly. When you see the white line in the middle of the left back wheel; take a full turn to the left then move slowly then you will be inside the pocket parking. I hope it helps!!!

            <RelCText>NO. you cant drive with other then GCC license. I also think that I can but law is clear. You need to make all procedure to exchange or make Qatari an driving license. Be sure all stories that you can drive is wrong. If you make any accident then you will see the problems. Best wishes. p.s. if you go to make driving license and you fall...make like I was...give to Sudani man big boss there some money and this is it. I give 1000 QAR and in 3 time I get licence. This is not secret just life in Doha. Corruption every where. Can you imagine that I fall 2 times at driving tests like I dont know how to drive... I have in my 50 years more then 20 diff. nice good cars... and I have more then 26 years driver lic. and more then 1.000.000 km behind me in all Europe countries... Not like new comer Indian people who use bicycle before and now make so many accident in Doha. Every day I see 5-6 accident. Driver? So sorry just true-Indian.

            <RelCText>Even if you have a International License; you need to get a temporary license from Traffic Department. When you are in Doha; get the application for temporary license and submit it to the Madinat Khalifa Traffic Department along with copy of your US license and passport pages showing your identity and visa page You might need to get an NOC from the sponsor (Typed in Arabic) if you visit here under visa from some company or sponsor. Best way is to ask the rental car company to assist you to get it.</RelCText>

            <RelCText>Supposedly the US license is good for (7) days. An international license is good for (6) months. They are easily obtained from AAA for about $15. After (6) months and likely before then you would need to go for a Qatar drivers license.</RelCText>

            <RelCText>"dogs in Islam are acceptable so long as they serve a ""purpose"". In my own home; they provide security. There are steps to take in the Muslim faith so that dogs are allowed (concerns washing dishes; the person if touched; etc.) My main concern is that this has been allowed to be interpreted as dogs are ""haram"" - and some people take this as a reason to be cruel and abusive. One (western) person I know said that this was due to ""Arab cruelty"" (his words; not mine); I in turn replied ""I feel sorry for those who think lke that (and you) because some people (and not just those of the Muslim faith) do not know how much security and real affection dogs can give - they are always happy to see you no matter your state of mind or emotions. All they ask is sufficient food; water; to be treated without pain or hurt; and a few kind words."""</RelCText>

            <RelCText>He's going to his new home this weekend. Why do you want a labrador? Have you had experience with this breed before? Labradors are far from easy to keep and need a huge amount of exercise so they don't get destructive. Have you had dogs before? Where will it live? Have you thought about what you will do when you go on vacation? Or leave Qatar for good? Have you looked into all the costs involved with having a dog - from adoption fees; vaccinations; food; boarding kennels etc.</RelCText>

            <RelCText>I think work experience is not a prerequisite for taking the NHA exam that is now handled by Prometric. You can try to schedule the exam online. However; there's no point of taking the exam without the required work experience since it is one of the requirements to get NHA license. Moreover; if you pass the exam; the validity is only for 2 years; otherwise you have to take it again.</RelCText>

            <RelCText>you can take Prometric exam without experience. My exam's validity is 3 yrs... There are many nurses out there are working without license. Private clinics are very strict on accepting new nurse applicants. Your lucky to practice your profession with license here; but beware my friend... You need to be extra careful bec. that's ILLEGAL</RelCText>

            <RelCText>"Considering nationality; income etc is a smart thing to do IMHO. Nationality differences can lead to disputes about where you will live; if it is accepted to the family; if you will be able to get your spouse into your country and many more. As for financial status; love is great but it doesnt pay the bills. I for one wouldnt want to have a future with someone if we didnt have a pot to p*ss in or a window to throw it out my entire life; but I guess thats just my female gold digging instinct. I love the fact that someone stated that we girls/ladies are the only ones who see their potential partner as an investment. _____________________________________________________ ""Diplomacy is the art of saying 'Nice doggie' until you can find a rock - Will Rogers"""</RelCText>

            <RelCText>brit.. i'd add to your list: a real love is UNRETURNED one.. if we love with the condition that he/she loves us in return; it is already Conditional love.. how many times we hear: &#8221;Oh; he is bas**rd; he doesn't give you what you deserve; LEAVE HIM&#8221;.. it is initially wrong.. if you are with the person just for RECEIVING what you &#8220;deserve&#8221;; it is not love..

            <RelCText>love is something we dont have now adays... my answer to Amoud that somehow you are right but thousand of years ago our ancestors doesn't even bother about financial status... they can go to the woods and hunt or cut trees to build shelters..find foods and they enjoy life everyday... but since people become greedy &amp; lazy... they have develop a system or hierarchy that devide us.. love is not about future.. it is the devine force that inspired us to do good things for the one we love.</RelCText>

Batman; a provisional driving licence-holder; was found to be over the drink-drive limit. Superman; who held a full driving licence; was also breath-tested and found to be the same. Both men have now been charged. The pair were among 15 people who were arrested in Fife as part of a clampdown on drink driving. Fife Police said the pair of superheroes were stopped near Anstruther in the early hours of Sunday morning. The two men; both in their early 20s; were on their way home from a fancy-dress party when they were ordered to pull over. A source at Fife Police said: ""This is a real fall from grace for two superheroes. I am sure drink driving is not allowed in Gotham City; and it is certainly not to allow....."</RelCText>

            <RelCText>I dont think you get good ones in Doha. Are you looking for white? mostly wedding dresses in India comes in bright colors mostly in red. You can do a Google search there are some Indian designers who take online orders. Try Dana Centre in Souq they have some heavy Lacha/Lehnga material... not sure if someone here can stich it properly.</RelCText>

            <RelCText>Well if you dont plan to travel to India to get your stuff you can try the Dulhan; Bombay Silk; and all other stores on KHARABA Street. Or else if you have plenty of time in hand order online. Just keep in mind while placing an online order that you have minimum of a month and a half before your wedding.

            <RelCText>you can't go wrong with either car; however; the Camry is bigger. You will get good resale for any Toyota. And an older Camry is nothing to worry about; a 2009 Camry is pretty much just starting it's life..4 years is nothing for a Toyota engine and there are Camrys with 800000kms still running around happily with no problems..You'll probably die long before your Camry does haha</RelCText>

            <RelCText>just make sure that whatever car you decide to buy; has a full service record and stay away from cars with unknown histories..a car is only as good as its maintenance and even a Camry/Corolla has to depend on its owner to take care of it. You can take it for an evaluation to the Bosch Service Center where for 500 Qr. they will give you a bumper to bumper report on the condition of the car..you'll need to leave it with them for half a day though..I suggest its money and time well spent to ensure you get a good reliable car.. Best of luck</RelCText>

            <RelCText>Frankly speaking; all pakistani schools suck . as none of them have any standard if we compare them to the Indian schools. However; out of the available one; Bright future is the best. DO not go for a lower fee paksitnai school as PEC would be the lowest. If you can afford; get your children in private school like Cambridge etc or otherwise Bright Future is the best.</RelCText>

            <RelCText>There are three Pakistani schools here in Qatar.. PEC; Pakshama and Bright Future and to be honest; they all suck big time. I studied in Pakshama from 80 to 88 but it wasn't so bad that time. We had mostly Indian teachers so the standard of English was pretty good. But then somewhere end of the 80's or beginning of 90's they removed all Indian teachers and hired Pakistani teachers so their standard detoriated in a few months. I shifted to PEC in 88 or 89 and I was shocked to see Pathan teachers who could not speak or write English properly. They were pathetic in grammar and pronunciation. In 1996 I got a job at Bright Future when they had just opened. I have seen their method and standard of teaching very closely.. They are just as bad as the other two. I would advise you to send your children to some international school if you can afford or else to one of the Indian schools.. There are five of them here and all are equally good..

            <RelCText>My eldest son is at Bright Future Pakistani. Honestly; I am not satisfied with the school. They dont have good standard. My son is having problem with his study there. Lack of attention from the teacher and lack of skill of teaching also. They dont have activities to boost the interest of learning for the kids. lack of creativity. Too much URDU Lesson (which I dont understand how to help him with his Urdu homework). If you lucky; your child will be teached by skilled teacher (my son had a very nice and good teacher when he was at KG2 at the same school). Unfortunately this year for grade 1; he's stuck with unskilled teacher :( Indian school? yes they are good; but very difficult to get space. We've been trying for a year now. NO LUCK !! Other international Schools? They suck our blood out ! One thing good is that we can afford the fee of BFS. (My husband is a Pakistani but I am not)</RelCText>

            <RelCText>airport visa (Example: tourist visa/business visa) what do you mean by airport visa? airport visa has 2 category whether tourist or business visa. how come there is no more airport visa wherein there is tourist and business visa. if there is no airport visa then there should be no tourist or business visa. even if you will go to a hotel; they will give you only a tourist or a business visa.pls review your question</RelCText>

            <RelCText>Airport Tourist visa (personal sponsorship) is stopped; and Airport Business visa (Company sponsorship)is still issued.

            <RelCText>Some people are giving wrong informations about tourist visa; they cant stop tourist visa as they are promoting tourisum these days; you can bring your relatives only by tourist visa for 14 day and can be extended for another 14 days; after 28 days you need to exit from Qatar to any nearest Airport and can come back again with another tourist visa; this is allowded only 2 exit mean 28+28+28 maximum approx. three months 54 days only not for 6 months as some one says.</RelCText>

            <RelQSubject>Dying of Work</RelQSubject>
            <RelQBody>Has someone actually died of work ever? I guess I'll be the first one. It's a overnight for me tonight. Just like last two 3 am nights. Have been working continously for three days now. I feel like passing out. There's a board meeting day after and work is only half finished. Is it bye bye Doha time ? I have never been so scared in my life. Give me some sympathy please. Excess QLing has done this to me. I wish I had known better and had not kept backlogs.</RelQBody>

            <RelCText>Ask for 13;000 housing and also a list of schools they will pay for when your child becomes school age (or allowance of 45;000 for schools if you agree to stay that long).

            <RelCText>for starters; it is a good package and i believe you should take up the offer. You should negotiate on the part where the company provide insurance for the entire family. No logic in them providing insurance just for you. Second; do negotiate the car allowance coz if you plan to rent a car; a good vehicle; say a honda civic would cost you qrs. 2500. a 4WD would cost you much more. Third; do check where your working base is going to be. Is it in Al Khor? If yes; it is a nice location along with a community where your family will feel at home. I stated Al Khor coz most of the leading big petroleum companies are in the Al Khor side. All the best. Cheerios</RelCText>

            <RelCText>it depends upon the position; for ex; i know for a fact that a candidate was rejected becasue he couldnt spot a shade of green properly; he wasnt colour blind; there was a lot of defence for his case; but he was rejected because he couldnt recognise a shade of green. here it probably mattered becasue he would be working in the lab. so it really depends upon the field of activity.

            <RelCText>looks like you are refering to a lady engineer; if her work isnt field related; then theres a good possibility of her getting through; moreover if she is really good and the department encourages her case; a lot can happen. because in such cases; if the candidate is really deserving the HR may forward the case to the concerend department to reach a final decision.if the dept insists on having her and that her problem wont interfere with work; then anything is possible. all in its good time. happy heart DRIVE SAFE;someone is waiting for you at home</RelCText>

            <RelQSubject>Working for Al Jazeera International</RelQSubject>
            <RelQBody>I'll be joining Al Jazeera International ; a dream I've had for some time now. I need to ask anyone; employees of Al Jazeera or anyone working in Qatar; what kind of accommodation is provided by Al Jazeera for singles. Im worried that pre-determined accommodation may be unsuitable or in an unsafe neighbourhood. Can anyone help me out on this? Id really appreciate it. Thanks</RelQBody>

            <RelCText>I don't think you have anything to worry about. We know a couple of Al Jazeera Int'l employees and they were given really great spacious furnished apartments (I think they were 3bdrm). And then those that had family accommodations were given villas in a great compound.</RelCText>

            <RelCText>Hi Che and others; I'm also coming to Doha to work for Al Jazeera Insha Allah. Apart from waiting over 2 months now for my flight intinary since signing the contract (!) I also had the same concerns about the accomodation. Does anyone know if the accomodation that is given to employees is in a specific compound or area; or do they have a network of landlords on their books and choose that way; and does that mean the apartments could be anywhere in the capital? cheers and all the best</RelCText>

            <RelCText>aljazeera is an equal opportunity company so your nationality should not matter; I also got a job offer there and am still waiting to finalize things. I already visited the company and I was thrilled with the place and the employees; they are extremely nice and helpful which you don't really find in much TV stations so it is a blessing. As per your concern about accomodation; from what I heard is that all employees who are married and have children are provided with a very decent villa in a compound and single employees are provided with a 3 bdrm furnished apartment in a nice place as well. After all aljazeera has a big name and I dont think they will throw their employees(their best resources) in a place that is unfit or unsafe. Good luck and I hope to see you there.</RelCText>

            <RelCText>You often find that when Megamart get something new in they slap a ridiculously high price on it in the hope that people will just buy it (which we often do; clearly). But I've quite often seen that a few weeks later the price is drastically reduced; sometimes halved; presumably because not enough people were buying it at the ridiculous price.</RelCText>

            <RelCText>"Hi; I strongly recommend Evian. It's a bit more expensive than other water but it's worth it and you find it in all Carrefours. You can never be sure about other producers here unfortunately...if you decide to go for another brand; make sure Sodium content is less than 20. We just arrived here a month ago from the UK too and my 6 months old is on Evian. My 5 year old was also on it when she was little. Also; what formula are you using? they are not always identical to UK ones. I tried Nestle's NAN but it gave her green poo so we switched to Aptamil and she seems to be fine now. I don't know if it's your first baby but in case it is - don't worry to much about what is so called ""recommended milk intake is"" - both my daughters always took at least 30% less than was recommended for their age and their weight has still been absolutely normal. Feel free to send me a personal message if you need more advice."</RelCText>

            <RelCText>Maybe your grandson still adjusting with the situation and the weather here. Because it happened also to my baby when we were travelling. She didn`t drink her milk like before; but after few days everything is back to normal. And for the water i recommend Nestle; or Masafi. Good luck</RelCText>

            <RelQSubject>Best bars in town and on going rate?</RelQSubject>
            <RelQBody>Now we all know which bars have the pros; though there have been some dispute on it(whether all girls in the bar or some of them in the bars are pros). Now the question arises ; what are their rates?Any one like to share some or all of the knowledge).</RelQBody>

            <RelCText>"There's a book out there somewhere written by an expat; called ""Ten Times the Price of a Haircut"" Where he claims that should be the going rate in any town in the world. That said; I pay QR15 here; and used to pay SR5 in Riyadh; but I doubt there are any fifty riyal hookers there! Did you Google it first?"</RelCText>
